# Moblile-Call-Log-Analysis
This project allows users to analyze their mobile call log data in various ways, including tracking the call duration, call frequency, and distribution of calls between different contacts or parties. The analysis is visualized using pie charts for call distribution and line graphs for call duration trends over time. The application is built with Flask for the backend, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and Python for data processing and visualization.
